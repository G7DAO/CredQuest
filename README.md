# CredLancer / CredQuest
On-chain Credentialing &  Collaboration Platform for Game Studios & Developers 

## Summary: 
The CredLancer platform facilitates collaboration & skill verification for professionals. Organisations provide team member verification, role badging & project completion incentives. Freelancers showcase their expertise, bid for projects, and meet other professionals. 

## Problem: 
There is a lack of communication and collaboration between game developers. While many have an interest in Web3 integration, there is no place to effectively meet, research and level-up with qualified professionals. 

## Solution:
The CredQuest platform allows the gaming community to come together and build collaboratively while showcasing verified on-chain credentials. 

## Getting Started:
Game Studios can register their members. Once their team members sign up, they can allocate on-chain badges(soul bound tokens) verifying their experience or roles in the company. 

Game Developers can showcase their expertise, find like-minded professionals, and bid on development challenges.

Both Game Studios and Developers can upload challenges for the community to collaboratively solve.
